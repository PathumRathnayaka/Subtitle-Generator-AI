A secure password generation tool that creates unique, platform-specific passwords based on user inputs. Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive user interface, and powered by a **Node.js + Express** backend for secure password generation.

## ✨ Features

- **Platform-Specific Passwords**: Generates unique passwords for each platform (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn).
- **Secure Hashing**: Uses **PBKDF2** with **SHA-256** for secure password generation.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and responsive user interface built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Backend Integration**: Powered by a **Node.js + Express** backend for secure password generation.
- **CORS Support**: Ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Cryptography**: PBKDF2 (SHA-256)
- **Security**: CORS, Salting

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Users input their details (e.g., name, NIC number, birthday, unique word, unique ID).
2. The backend combines these inputs with a platform-specific salt and hashes them using **PBKDF2**.
3. The frontend displays unique, secure passwords for each platform.
